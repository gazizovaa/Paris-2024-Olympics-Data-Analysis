# Paris-2024-Olympics-Data-Analysis
<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>The initial step was to implement data extraction process from the official website. Since the official website of Paris 2024 Olympics has been unable to import fast, I decided to import data of medals table from a Wikipedia page through the URL in MS Excel:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the <strong>Data</strong> tab in the ribbon.</li>
  <li>Click on <strong>Get Data</strong>, then select <strong>From Other Sources</strong>, and click on the <strong>From Web</strong> option.</li>
</ul>
  <p>After this step, a pop-up window will be appeared asking for a URL. I entered the URL of the medals page, then click <strong>OK</strong>.Then, it's time to connect it to the webpage.</p>
